    "title": "About Quinta do Mocho",
    "description1": "Quinta do Mocho is a public housing neighbourhood in Sacavém, just outside Lisbon. Built in the 1990s to rehouse families from informal settlements, it is one of many bairros sociais created through Portugal's urban social housing policies. Today, it is home to a vibrant African diaspora community — especially families with Cape Verdean, Angolan, and Guinean-Portuguese heritage.",
    "description2": "Music, food, art, and strong intergenerational ties are central to daily life here. Despite economic challenges and high youth unemployment, the neighbourhood is full of talent. Musicians, dancers, designers, and athletes from Mocho have gained recognition both nationally and internationally. The potential is here — it just needs space to grow.",
